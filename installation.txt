sudo npm install -g loopback-cli

it gave me error, I searched the error and there I found two options aded in the end of the to give the root access.

the command did not work so set an alias as follow:

alias lb=/home/kayvan/bin/node-v8.11.3-linux-x64/bin/lb

to test if the loopback is installed

lb -v


to create the project run the bellow command and follow the instruction, during the process it asks about the project type, I chose the one with "user auth", actually the first.

lb


then 

lb datasource

then lb model to create models, I used type common


lb model

in server/component-config.json

{
  "loopback-component-explorer": {
    "mountPath": "/explorer",
    "generateOperationScopedModels": true
  },
  "loopback3-xtotalcount": {
    "pattern": ["*.find"]
  }
}



middleware.json

        "maxAge": 86400,
        "exposedHeaders": "X-Total-Count"



Now the react-admin

npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app xcpilots-backoffice
cd xcpilots-backoffice/
npm add react-admin
npm add aor-loopback
npm start
